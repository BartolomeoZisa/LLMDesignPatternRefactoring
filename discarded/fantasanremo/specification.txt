The Artista class implements the following methods (for "extra points", no analogous method is needed):

calcola_punteggioBM(self, punti_base: int) -> int: 
This method returns the number of Bonus/Malus points the artist contributes to the team, 
based on their role (starter/reserve/captain). For a reserve, it returns 0; 
for others, it returns the base points (punti_base).

calcola_punteggioPosizione(self, punti_base: int) -> int:
 This method returns the number of position points the artist contributes to the team based on their role (starter/reserve/captain).
It can return 0, the base points (punti_base), or double the base points (2 * punti_base).

In case the artist is assigned an unknown role, the method should return 0.
