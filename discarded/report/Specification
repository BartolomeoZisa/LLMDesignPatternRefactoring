The system must support the generation of environmental reports, exported in PDF format,
customized for different types of users: citizens, local managers, and administrators. All reports
refer to a given time interval (start date - end date). However, each type of user receives different details
in the reports:

Citizens receive a summary report showing pollution levels at the beginning and end of the interval.

Local managers receive a detailed report with an analysis of environmental data, ongoing interventions
at the end of the interval, or those completed within the interval.

Administrators receive a strategic report with aggregated statistics, comparison with regulatory
thresholds, and overall costs of interventions completed within the interval.
